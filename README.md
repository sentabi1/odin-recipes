This is my first project, and I'm really excited about making something all by myself.

For when I'm finished: It feels good finally getting something completed. This is the farthest I've ever traveled on my programming journey, and it feels great to accomplish something. This is only the beginning, and I know it'll only be more and more enjoyable as time goes on.
